# manipulandum_initial_process

This is a set of R scripts for initial processing on manipulandum "raw" data files, creating midfiles that you can use for your own analyses.
For a moment, this is tuned for my experiment task (i.e., visuomotor rotation task), which will be edited to accommodate other types of tasks (e.g., FF adaptaiton task).
